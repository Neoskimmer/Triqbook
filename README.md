You might find yourself asking: "What is Triqbook and why do I need it?" Here's why:Triqbook is a thing built in Turbowarp (https://turbowarp.org/editor/) which is an editor/mod for scratch. I use scratch/turbowarp because I don't know anything else and I'm not bothered to learn anything else.
Also, scratch is just superior to EVERYTHING because it works so smoothly and can be compiled into anything, even windows programs.

Feel free to try out the old versions/the new versions, because the final version isn't done yet and won't be done for a while due to school and stuff :)))

The files provided can be used in different ways. I have provided a stand-alone HTML version, the source code, and the .zip file contains the HTML, Javascript, and CSS needed to make the whole website (which isn't up yet).

The html is just a simple download and open.

The source code, however, is to be downloaded and imported into https://turbowarp.org/
Later I will get rid of this option, to ensure that no-one can cheat, because that's just annoying. If someone DOES work out how to cheat, then create an issue and I will try to workout the bug or whatever. 

The .zip with the HTML + the JS + the CSS can be uploaded to a website like https://w3spaces.com/ for a test. I think.

To request a feature, just create an issue on github and I'll try to respond as fast as possible.

I (Neoskimmer) made the game and all the art :)))

The background (the moving squares thing) was built by Bluezebra289. Go check them out at https://scratch.mit.edu/users/bluezebra289
