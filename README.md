# Triqbook

Triqbook is built in Turbowarp (https://turbowarp.org/editor/) which is an editor/mod for scratch.
I use scratch/turbowarp because I don't know anything else and I'm not bothered to learn anything else.
Also, scratch is just superior to EVERYTHING. 

Feel free to try out the old versions/the new versions, because the final version isn't done yet and won't be done for a while

# How to use

The files provided can be used in different ways. I have provided a stand-alone HTML version, the source code, and later will provide the application for Windows and Mac.

The html is just a simple download and open.

The source code, however, is to be downloaded and imported into https://turbowarp.org/
Later I will get rid of this option, to ensure that no-one can cheat, because that's just annoying. If someone DOES work out how to cheat, then create an issue and I will try to workout the bug or whatever. That's it for now.

# Requested features
 
To request a feature, just create an issue on github and I'll try to respond as fast as possible.

# Credits

I made the game and all the art and stuff. I didn't make the font though.

The background (the moving squares thing) was built by Bluezebra289. Go check them out at https://scratch.mit.edu/users/bluezebra289
The Music is called "Getting It Done" by Kevin Macleod and is so good :D
